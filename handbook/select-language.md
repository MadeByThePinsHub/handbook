## Current Translations
* [English [Original Language Written]](https://en.handbooksbythepins.cf) - **YOU ARE HERE**

## Want to help out?
* [**Fork this repository and start translating**](remix). When you fork the handbook repo for localization, please ask us to enlist your language here as we'll use it when new translations are approved from Crowdin.
* [**Use Crowin**](remix-on-crowdin). We are using Crowdin to simpifly localization and review process and in turn merging those translations to the forks.
