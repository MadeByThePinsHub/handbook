The **Development and Operations** (or simply DevOps), is an [enterprise](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/enterprise.html) software development phrase used to mean a type of agile relationship between IT and development operations[^1]

## In this section
Just like [GitLab Handbook's Engineering section], we keep most of them here.[^2]

## Communication

### Keeping yourself updated
As part of a fully distributed organization such as GitLab, it is important to stay informed about engineering led initiatives. The Pins team employ [multimodal communication], which describes the minimum set of communication channels we'll broadcast to.

For the DevOps department, any important initiative will be announced in:
* Telegram Messenger
    * [The Developers' Lounge] and [Developers' Changelogs]
        * All members of the department should become chat members as part of the onboarding process. If this is not the case for you or you didn't use Telegram Messenger, reach out to either your **Department Maintainer** or **Team Maintainer**.
        * On the offboarding process, you can leave those chats if you want.
* Department Mailing Lists
    * Also part of the onboarding process, you'll be ntifed by our staff about the department mailing lists. Follow instuctions as stated.
* On GitLab.com
    * Issue discussions with the labels `~"DevOps Department::Discussion Board"`, `~"Unfiltered::DevOps Department Discussions"` and
    * For "~security" labelled issues,
    * `~"Week In Review::DevOps"` and `~"Week In Review"`
        * Week-in-Review document updates are announced with this tag in Team Issue Tracker Board.

If you frequently check any of these channels, you can consider yourself informed. It is up to the person sharing to ensure that the same message is shared across all channels. Ideally, this message should be a one sentence summary with a link to an issue to allow for a single source of truth for any feedback.
