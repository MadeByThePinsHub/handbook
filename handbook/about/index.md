## History of the handbook
The handbook started when Andrei Jiroh (@AndreiJirohHaliliDev2006)

## Counting the handbook pages
It's easy to see that the handbook is large, but have you ever wondered just _how large_? If it were printed in 12-point, single-spaced Arial it would be well over three thousand pages long and that's not even counting the images. That's a lot of good info![^1]
