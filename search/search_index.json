Effective Date The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution. 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor: (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions. This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4). 2.4. Subsequent Licenses No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3). 2.5.

Conditions Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1. 3. Responsibilities ------------------- 3.1. Distribution of Source Form All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form. 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then: (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License. 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s). 3.4. Notices You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 3.5. Application of Additional Terms You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction. 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation --------------------------------------------------- If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 5. Termination -------------- 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate. 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination. ************************************************************************ * * * 6.

Miscellaneous ---------------- This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof.

Advantages \u00b6 Like GitLab, the Pins team's handbook is extensive and keeping it relevant is an important part of everyone's job. It is a vital part of who we are and how we communicate. We established these processes because we saw these benefits: Reading is much faster than listening. Reading is async, you don't have to interrupt someone or wait for them to become available. Recruiting is easier if people can see what we stand for and how we operate. Retention is better if people know what they are getting into before they join. On-boarding is easier if you can find all relevant information spelled out. Teamwork is easier if you can read how other parts of the company work. Discussing changes is easier if you can read what the current process is. Communicating change is easier if you can just point to the diff. Everyone can contribute to it by proposing a change via a merge request. One common concern newcomers to the handbook express is that the strict documentation makes the team more rigid. In fact, writing down our current process in the handbook has the effect of empowering contributors to propose change. As a result, this handbook is far from rigid. You only need to look at the handbook changelog (currently in Git commits) to see the evidence. Counting the handbook pages \u00b6 It's easy to see that the handbook is large, but have you ever wondered just how large ? If it were printed in 12-point, single-spaced Arial it would be well over three thousand pages long and that's not even counting the images. That's a lot of good info! 1 Historical Records \u00b6 We are using WordCounter with the defaults like the Arial font, single spacing and in size 14. Date 2 Words Pages without pictures and embeds 3 2020-03-24 6,422 ~14.3 2020-04-20 8,360 ~18.6 Computing the Handbook Pages \u00b6 While the CI is running, the words_counter job Look for the total words count in the CI logs, then launch WordCounter and paste the count you copied from the console. Submit and you'll see the results! See Also \u00b6 On our repository where the handbook source code lives on GitLab.com, see what changes happened in the staging branch in real-time as you read this. How about reading this page from GitLab Handbook where we adopted most of them? As we update the things, we configured GitLab CI to count how many words our handbook have in real-time before Mkdocs kicks off the builder. \u21a9 We update the historical records on a random schedule. \u21a9 Words per page calucations are just estimates and are not 100% accurate so they have ~ in front of it. \u21a9","title":"History of Handbook"},{"location":"about/#history-of-the-handbook","text":"The handbook started when Andrei Jiroh ( @AndreiJirohHaliliDev2006 ) visits the GitLab Handbook and he was impressed by how large the GitLab Handbook is it.","title":"History of the handbook"},{"location":"about/#advantages","text":"Like GitLab, the Pins team's handbook is extensive and keeping it relevant is an important part of everyone's job.

This tutorial is an two-part series, one for setting it up locally and in the cloud, written in an single article. So, this tutorial might typically takes 60-90 minutes to follow. Objectives \u00b6 After this tutorial, you'll learned to: * set up virtual environments * install and setup VirtualBox, an open-source VM manager for Windows, Mac and Linux. * install an Linux distro in an VM * launching, pausing, and stopping VMs * setting up VMs in the cloud. Part 1: VirtualBox \u00b6 In this tutorial, we're using VirtualBox , but feel free to use any other heyrvisors available. We recommend using open-source solutions instead of paying money just using VMare Player If you are using propiertary software,] we have been warned you because propiertary apps have hidden backdoors used by governments to spy on you and have their source code censored.
