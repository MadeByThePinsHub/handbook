title: Artifacts Retention Policies
---

To help GitLab manage artifacts storage while optmizing for other usages of othe projects (in case of GitLab.com) or even on our on-perm GL installations, we need to set artifacts to expire after a specific peroid.

## Why we have an artifacts retention policy

We hate beating the red lights on storage limits

## Defining how many days an artifact to retain

To define how many days a GitLab instance to keep artifacts after successful CI run, add the following code to the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file on the root folder of an project at a job. See [this example](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevLabs/official-handbook/-/blob/dbb9383965c89eb7f88b75dfdc6a95bc63a7e288/.gitlab-ci.yml) for if you want to see its usage in real-life.

```yaml
  artifacts:
    expire_in: 7 days
```

    That was on another topic, [Using Auto DevOps](../the-gitlab-way/runners/auto-devops), which we detail about
    customizing the Auto DevOps template.
