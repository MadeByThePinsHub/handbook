title: The GitLab Way
---
Our handbook's **The GitLab Way** contains nifty gitty things on what and how we do and use GitLab in our daily DevOps business as we use Git.

## GitLab What

GitLab is a single application to the entire [DevOps](./devops). Its source code is open-source, even the [Enterprise Edition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee) (Heads up! To get most of your GitLab EE installation, an license key is required. See [pricing page](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/#self-managed) for info.). You don't need to switch tabs between apps if you want to just use one app for 10 tools.

## Ahh, I understand that about GitLab. Why am I here again
