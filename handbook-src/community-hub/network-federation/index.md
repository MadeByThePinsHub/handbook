| [Sophie (stable)] | `1644721b-aa71-4c33-b19b-33e3812d40f2` | `/fjoin 1644721b-aa71-4c33-b19b-33e3812d40f2` or `/fsub 1644721b-aa71-4c33-b19b-33e3812d40f2` | Up-to-date, count seems to be inaccurate. Blame [Yacha](https://t.me/MrYacha) for inaccuracies. |
| [Saitama (stable)] | `f0f172c5-3deb-4746-ac07-5243240e6b0e` | `/joinfed f0f172c5-3deb-4746-ac07-5243240e6b0e` or `/subfed f0f172c5-3deb-4746-ac07-5243240e6b0e` | Lagging behind 1000+ bans, blame [Sawada Tsunayoshi](https://t.me/Sawada) not to test fimports. |
| [Haruka Aya] | `6a75b4a2-c58b-4814-b5ac-807855d8db34` | `/joinfed 6a75b4a2-c58b-4814-b5ac-807855d8db34` or `/subfed 6a75b4a2-c58b-4814-b5ac-807855d8db34` | Lagging behind 1000+ bans because the code that powers feds is a pile of shit code sum up together, they used to but not now due to the fact TCP db connection + DBLock make it take forever to import (up to 2 days) and hence why the bot itself is kinda slow.[^1] |

[^1]: That's was a reply from their support staff. Shut up.
[^2]: Actually, they commented out because it's untested.
