## Joining the Federation

If you're using these bots below, you can join to our Community Network fed (subscribe if you have an fed). We recommend to use Rose and join there because our fbanlist is more up-to-date and also our fed is

| Bot | ID | How to join/subscribe? | Status
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Rose] | `381c5253-3f46-4e9b-8b2d-d141174b8444` | `/joinfed 381c5253-3f46-4e9b-8b2d-d141174b8444` or `/subfed 381c5253-3f46-4e9b-8b2d-d141174b8444` | Up-to-date |
| [Sophie (stable)] | `1644721b-aa71-4c33-b19b-33e3812d40f2` | `/fjoin 1644721b-aa71-4c33-b19b-33e3812d40f2` or `/fsub 1644721b-aa71-4c33-b19b-33e3812d40f2` | Up-to-date, count seems to be inaccurate. Blame [Yacha](https://t.me/MrYacha) for inaccuracies. |
| [Saitama (stable)] | `f0f172c5-3deb-4746-ac07-5243240e6b0e` | `/joinfed f0f172c5-3deb-4746-ac07-5243240e6b0e` or `/subfed f0f172c5-3deb-4746-ac07-5243240e6b0e` | Lagging behind 1000+ bans, blame [Sawada Tsunayoshi](https://t.me/Sawada) not to test fimports. [^2] |
| [Haruka Aya] | `6a75b4a2-c58b-4814-b5ac-807855d8db34` | `/joinfed 6a75b4a2-c58b-4814-b5ac-807855d8db34` or `/subfed 6a75b4a2-c58b-4814-b5ac-807855d8db34` | Lagging behind 1000+ bans because the code that powers feds is a pile of shit code sum up together, they used to but not now due to the fact TCP db connection + DBLock make it take forever to import (up to 2 days) and hence why the bot itself is kinda slow.[^1] |
| [Kigyō] | TBA | TBA | Because its repo is based from [Saitama (Stable)], we're gonna wait for any updates.
| [Exusisa (Heroku Aya)] | TBA | TBA | Because its repo is based from [Haruka Aya], we're gonna wait for any updates.
