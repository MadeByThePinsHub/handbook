This also applies to our bans on [Watchdog Chat Guard](https://t.me/WatchdogChatGuard_bot).

### Common Reasons

Please consult the list below before you initiate a federation ban. Otherwise, somebody who have right to do a fedban will amend your ban reason to be compliant with the valid ones here.

| `Flagged by SpamWatchers` | Likely flagged by federations other than SpamWatch. Mostly found in cryptoscammers. | No, you need to stop spamming everywhere in Telegram. We only lift your fedban if other federations unfedban you. |
| `Reported in SpamWatch Support Chat` | Old reason for people who get reported in SpamWatch Support, now obsolete. Use `Reported in <federation name> Support` instead. | Yes, unless you're now banned in [SpamWatch](https://t.me/SpamWatch). |
| `<category here> Spam` or `Spammer detected` | Likely this person is spmming around the chats. | Yes, but only if you stop. It might depends on your case. |
| `spam[gban]` | Simplified ban reason that [Simon Hitler](https://t.me/SitiSchu) used. | Depends on how you spammed.
| `Self-promoter detected in <chat name>` | Self-promoting in Telegram is considered as spam. | Yes, but only if you stop.
| `NSFW Stuff` | Sharing NSFW content in Telegram isn't allowed, as per their ToS. | Yes, but only if you stop. If not, we'll reserve the right to report it to `abuse@telegram.org`.

| `Globally banned in @SatiamaBot / Appeal in @OnePunchSupport` | Not all of gbans in [@SatiamaBot](https://t.me/SatiamaBot) will get banned here, unless there's API for that in the future. | Yes, but you need to appeal first in [One Punch Support](https://t.me/OnePunchSupport).
