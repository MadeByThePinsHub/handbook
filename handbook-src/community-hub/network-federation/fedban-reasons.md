title: Valid FedBan Reasons
description: Curious about our federation ban reasons?
---
Team members with federation administration permissions in [Rose](https://t.me/MissRose_bot) and/or [Haruka Aya](https://t.me/HarukaAyaBot) can do a federation ban across our Community Network. This also applies to our bans on [Watchdog Chat Guard](https://t.me/WatchdogChatGuard_bot).

!!! info "Not a fed admin?"
    If you are here because you got fedbanned, thanks for your interest to visiting here. We usually make our fedban reasons more transparent to everyone so they know if their ban reason is appealable or not.

## Categories
### Common Reasons
Please consult the list below before you initiate a federation ban. Otherwise, somebody who have right to do a fedban will amend your ban reason to be compliant with the valid ones here.

| Reason | What Does That Means? | Appealable?|
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `Reported in SpamWatch Support` | Someone got reported in the SpamWatch Support. Appeal in the [Federation Support](../support.md) | Yes, unless you're now banned in [SpamWatch](https://t.me/SpamWatch). |
| `Flagged by SpamWatchers` | Likely flagged by federations other than SpamWatch. Mostly found in cryptoscammers. | No, you need to stop spamming everywhere in Telegram. We only lift your fedban if other federations unfedban you. |
| `Reported in SpamWatch Support Chat` | Old reason for people who get reported in SpamWatch Support, now obsolete. Use `Reported in SpamWatch Support` instead. | Yes, unless you're now banned in [SpamWatch](https://t.me/SpamWatch). |
| `Spam` | 

### Rare Reasons
If your federation ban reason listed below, please contact our federation maintainers in the [Support Chat](../support.md/#contact-support). In some rare cases, we'll not allow you to given an parole unless otherwise decided by our side.

| Reason | What Does That Means? | Appealable? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `Pissed off when he/she got banned in SpamWatch` | We found in your federation logs that you banned [@SitiSchu](https://t.me/SitiSchu) in your federation when he banned you for whatever the reason is it. | No, unless you lift Simon's fedban and your appeal was granted in SpamWatch Support. |
| `Globally banned in @SatiamaBot / Appeal in @OnePunchSupport` | Not all of gbans in [@SatiamaBot](https://t.me/SatiamaBot) will get banned here, unless there's API for that in the future. | Yes, but you need to appeal first in [One Punch Support](https://t.me/OnePunchSupport). After lifting, contact Federation Support. |

## FedBan Reason Tags
Reason tags are in form of `[TAG HERE] REASON HERE / OTHER STUFF HERE`. If using more than one tags, it should look like `[FIRST TAG HERE / SECOND TAG HERE]
REASONS HERE`.

| Tag | What Does That Mean? | Appealable? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `[FLAGGED IN <FEDERATION NAME>]` | We found that you had been flagged in a federation. (e.g. Xiaomeme or Rose Support Fed). |
