description: Curious about our federation ban reasons? We have them.
---

Team members with federation administration permissions in [these bots](index.md) can do a federation ban across our Community Network. This also applies to our bans on [Watchdog Chat Guard](https://t.me/WatchdogChatGuard_bot).

!!! info "Not a fed admin?"
    If you are here because you got fedbanned, thanks for your interest to visiting here. We usually make our fedban
    reasons more transparent to everyone so they know if their ban reason is appealable or not.

## Alllowed Reasons

The lists below will be updated as more reasons to come. If you hate entering long reasons, [use the ban codes](#adapted-from-deai) instead.

### Common Reasons

Please consult the list below before you initiate a federation ban. Otherwise, somebody who have right to do a fedban will amend your ban reason to be compliant with the valid ones here.

| Reason | What Does That Means? | Appealable?|
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `Reported in <fed name> Support` | Someone got reported elsewhere and we pulled our guns. Appeal in the [Federation Support](./support.md) after getting unbanned. | Yes, unless you're now banned elsewhere. |
| `Flagged by SpamWatchers` | Likely flagged by federations other than SpamWatch. Mostly found in cryptoscammers. | No, you need to stop spamming everywhere in Telegram. We only lift your fedban if other federations unfedban you. |
| `Reported in SpamWatch Support Chat` | Old reason for people who get reported in SpamWatch Support, now obsolete. Use `Reported in <federation name> Support` instead. | Yes, unless you're now banned in [SpamWatch](https://t.me/SpamWatch). |
| `<category here> Spam` or `Spammer detected` | Likely this person is spmming around the chats, ranging from Whatsapp links | Yes, but only if you stop. It might depends on your case. |
| `spam[gban]` | Simplified ban reason that [Simon Hitler](https://t.me/SitiSchu) used. | Depends on how you spammed.
| `Self-promoter detected in <chat name>` | Self-promoting in Telegram is considered as spam. | Yes, but only if you stop.
| `NSFW Stuff` | Sharing NSFW content in Telegram isn't allowed, as per their ToS. This included CACP content.| No, you violated the Telegram ToS. We'll reserve the right to report it to `abuse@telegram.org`.
| `BLACKLISTED:0xCODEHERE` or `INTELLIVOID-SP:0xCODEHERE` | You're found to be blacklisted in Spam Protection. [Consult the operator's manual for the codes.](#intellivoid-spam-protection) | Appeal in [their Support](https://t.me/SpamProtectionSupport) first then contact us.
| `Spam Adder` / `spam adding N members` (where N is actual number of users who got spam added if you're using Simon's) | You added users into your chat/s without permission. | We can lift your ban, but you agree not to spam add members again.

### Rare Reasons

If your federation ban reason listed below, please contact our federation maintainers in the [Support Chat](../support.md/#contact-support). In some rare cases, we'll not allow you to given an parole unless otherwise decided by our side.

| Reason | What Does That Means? | Appealable? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `Pissed off when he/she got banned in SpamWatch` | We found in your federation logs that you banned [@SitiSchu](https://t.me/SitiSchu) in your federation when he banned you for whatever the reason is it. | No, unless you lift Simon's fedban and your appeal was granted in SpamWatch Support. |
| `Globally banned in @SatiamaBot / Appeal in @OnePunchSupport` | Not all of gbans in [@SatiamaBot](https://t.me/SatiamaBot) will get banned here, unless there's API for that in the future. | Yes, but you need to appeal first in [One Punch Support](https://t.me/OnePunchSupport). After lifting, contact Federation Support. |
| `Impersonating @<insert username here>` | Impersonating as somebody, either a person or a bot, is not allowed. | No. |
| `GPL Violation Flag on Marie forks` | We heard that somebody was just kanged the Marie forks' code, so we just remove them off our chats. | Yes, just make sure you make your fork open-source and credit the right people. |

## FedBan Reason Tags

Reason tags are in form of `[TAG HERE] REASON HERE / OTHER STUFF HERE`. If using more than one tags, it should look like `[FIRST TAG HERE / SECOND TAG HERE] REASONS HERE`.

| Tag | What Does That Mean? | Appealable? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| `[FLAGGED IN <FEDERATION NAME>]` | We found that you had been flagged in a federation. (e.g. Xiaomeme or Rose Support Fed). | Depending on your ban reason from tht fed. |
| `[FREE GBAN REQUESTED, DO NOT UNGBAN]` | You requested a free gban somewhere, so we gave you one. | See the Free Global Bans ToS for details. |
| `[SPECIAL REASON, ONLY THE FEDBANNER CAN LIFT THIS BAN]` | An special reason was raised. Only the gbanner and [Community Hubs Network Board members](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/Community-Hubs-Network-Board) can lift the ban. | It might depends on your special reason.
| `[BLACKLISTED IN SPAM PROTECTION]` | If you're curious why, check the [public logs](https://t.me/SpamProtectionLogs). ONLY USE THIS TAG IF NOT USING THE `BLACKLTED:0xCODEHERE` or `INTELLIVOID-SP:0xCODEHERE` REASON. | If you think you're wrongfully blacklisted, [appeal in Spam Protection Support](https://t.me/SpamProtectionSupport) then contact us afterwards.

## Federation/Global Ban Rules for FedAdmins

1. Don't add one word reasons like `retard` and `dumb`, provide reasoning.

2. These types are considered for Gbans
    - Adverts in group like join this, subscribe this or that.
    - Mass adding users to group.
    - Posting disgusting porn and other bs in sfw chats.
    - Mass private messaging users about promoting stuff.
    - Consult our FedBan reasons list (see above) before doing a ban.

3. PM's aren't always gban causes, first figure out what the user wants, random pm is okay if the agenda is okay as per rule 2.

4. Valid appeals can be given a one time chance depending on case.

5. Screenshots, videos by unknown people are not considered as any proof.

6. You will lose your access if you meme with gbans or do personal gbans, threaten others with it for no reason.

7. You can do a gban if you spot a evidence in OPM Support/SW Support/DEAI Support/SpamBlockers Blacklist Logs or Support.

8. Some miscelleaneous stuff, this can be updated anytime.

    - Owners of chats where a user is mass adding peeps will be considered for a gban based on how they respond.
    - Enforcers, Inspectors and Staffs at [Sibyl System](https://t.me/SibylSystem) can ask gbans based on their testimony but it would be put to test if their gban comes out to be a meme. (Since they're not FedAdmins here, gbans will take effect over our fbans. If you're an Enforcer/Inspector/Staff and want to be a FedAdmin here, inquire us in the [Issue Tracker of github:MadeByThePinsHub/Community-Hubs-Network-Board repo](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/Community-Hubs-Network-Board/issues/new).)
    - Being stupid isn't a gban reason.
    - Posting links related to your group aren't gban reason, use a ban or fban within your network/chats.
