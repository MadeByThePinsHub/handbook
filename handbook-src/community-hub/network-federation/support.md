## Contact Support

To contact support, we made a table for you to lessen our time explaining stuff.

| Method | Description | Link |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Federation Support Chat | The official feeration support chat of the Pins team. **Recommended for FedBan appeals across our network.** | <https://t.me/ThePinsTeam_FedSupport>. |
| Pool of Elon Musk Scam Reports Chat | The right place to dump reports to get banned across our network. | <https://t.me/FedbanRequestDumpingHub> |
