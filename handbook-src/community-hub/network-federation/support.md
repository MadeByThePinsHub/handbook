## Rules

- [**Read our General Rules first.**](https://telegra.ph/Community-Hub-Network-Rules-for-Telegram-Chats-05-24) They are still applied in
Federation Support, because it was managed by the Pins team.
- **No asking for unbans every day.** If you ask for a unban everyday, we'll temporarily mute you. If you still doing that, we'll
make your ban unappealable.
- **No deleting / editing out your messages.** Context in discussions is important.
- ~~**Swearing is also not allowed.** Our moderation bot will warn about that automatically.~~ This rule is not applicable and is being currently phrasing out.
- [**Check your ban reason before appealing.**](../fedban-reasons.md) We'll review

[^1]: In rare cases, we might pull them to our fed and simply prefixing the reason with `[FLAGGED IN <INSERT FED/ANTISPAM SERVICE HERE>]` (or `[BLACKLISTED IN SPAM PROTECTION]` for SP cases).
