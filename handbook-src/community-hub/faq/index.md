## What's Inside

### Currently WIP

* [Linus lying?](yt/lie-nus.md)

### Coming Soon

* [Anime Censorship? Holy $h!t!](censorship-101/anime.md)

## How to add more

Create a new issue in [our General GitLab Community Hub Network's Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/ThePinsTeam-CommunityHubNetwork/general/issues/new)
using the `Add a new Community Hub FAQ Entity`. We'll review them and if we'll approved it, we'll add it to our FAQ entities within days or weeks.

Merge Requests are also welcome in the handbook source repository if you want to help us author the Community FAQ entries.

## Want to edit them
