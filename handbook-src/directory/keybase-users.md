# Members with Keybase accounts

As more team members are joining Keybase and adding or updating their proofs, we need to update them periodically. Please create [a new issue](https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevLabs/official-handbook/issues/new) using the **Add my Keybase Account to list** template and we'll handle it with you.
