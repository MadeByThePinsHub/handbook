sudo apt-get install git
# Enter password for linux-sysadmin: REDACTED

# Afterwards, clone the whole repository.
# You can specify the folder name like this one.
# If you forget to do that, you can use this later: mv official-handbook-en ThePinsTeam-OfficialHandbook-en
git clone https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevLabs/official-handbook-en.git ThePinsTeam-OfficialHandbook-en

# Open the folder where you cloned the whole repository
cd ThePinsTeam-OfficialHandbook-en
```

* In case you don't have Git installed, you can download the source code as an `.zip` file. Extract it somewhere afterwards. Replace `master` in `official-handbook-en-master.zip` to the the branch yu want to export, like `official-handbook-en-staging.zip`

```bash
# We'll using wget to download those files. After downloading the zipped files, we'll unzip it.
wget https://gitlab.com/MadeByThePinsTeam-DevLabs/official-handbook/-/archive/staging/official-handbook-staging.zip | unzip -l "official-handbook-staging.zip"
```

* Install or update Python and `pip` to latest stable build using either Docker, your machine's package manager or from official Python website. Afterwards, install `mkdocs` and `mkdocs-material` using `pip` from the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

* Count how many

```bash
find handbook -type f | xargs wc -w
```

* Run an new development server by using `mkdocs serve` command. Edit as you go and it'll refreshes every single save. Inspect for any errors and fix it.

* When everything is clear, use `mkdocs build` to generate documentation website files.
