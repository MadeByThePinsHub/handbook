I would like to add my Keybase account to [this public list](https://en.handbooksbythepins.gq/directory/keybase-users) with my Keybase username, `<username here>`.

## I agree...
* that I can opt out from make my account listed publicly if I prefer to leave the team, delete my Keybase account or keep it secret.
* that I expect spam messages from random people.
* that the Pins team can use my username for internal communications, identity verification and adding to the official `madebythepinshub` open team, among other things.
* to [the Pins team's Privacy Policy](https://legal.madebythepins.tk/privacy/privacy-policy).
* that this request may be rejected by project maintainers due to not enough proofs or the proof are fishy/red-flagged.

## TO-DO for maintainers
* [ ] Comfirmed identity by reviewing Keybase proofs. **REQUIRED TO CONTINUE**
    * [ ] Have atleast 2 external accounts verified
    * [ ] Has a PGP key generated by the requestor from his/her machine or by the Keybase client
    * [ ] Have atleast 2 devices or had atleast one paper key.
* [ ] Add me to the list.
* [ ] Commit the changes to `develop` branch.
